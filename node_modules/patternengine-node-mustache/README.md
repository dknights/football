## The Mustache engine for Pattern Lab / Node

This one should be included by default with Mustache editions. If it's missing from your project for any reason, `npm install patternengine-node-mustache` should do the trick.

On dev right now the command is `npm install pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache#dev`
